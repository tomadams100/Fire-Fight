# Fire-Fight
## Can you save the day?

### Intro
In a land, far, far away, a house is on fire!

You, a humble fireman, must put the fire out before the temperature gets too hot and before running out of water.

Can you save the day...?

### Controls
Press the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys to control the water.

Press the "SPACE BAR" to control the water pressure.

### Aim
Each level you must not let the fire get too hot. Put out the fire as it appears and do so without running out of water! Luckily, you can collect extra water which appears randomly in the shape of a blue heart.

Each level fire will be created more frequently, see how long you can survive!
